Rendez-View is a webpage made for helping people plan a stay-at-home date, by providing a variety of cocktail, meal and movie choices.

When out team was tasked with solving a common problem, we realize that in these quarantined times, it is difficult to plan a special night for your significant other, and that we could always use some help planning these special nights.

That was where Rendez-View was born! Our webpage will help you make a blueprint for a truly special night. So that you'll never have to suffer through an underwhelming date, and will always wow that special someone.
